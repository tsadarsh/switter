Switter scraps your Twitter bookmraks and gives you a markdown file with these information:
 1. Tweeter name
 2. Tweeter username
 3. URL of tweet
 4. Date of tweet

Run `./switter` after making it an executable
 > chmod +x ./switter

## Requirements
Have the latest chrome webdriver installed within the **switter** directory. 
Scraped content is written in the same directory by default. Provide the full path while entering file name to save in custom location.
